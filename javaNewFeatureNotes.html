<h3>Java 7 new features (project <strong>Java_New_Features</strong>)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Binary literals, prefix with "0b" or "0B", i.e. byte eight = 0b1000;</li>
  <li>Underscore to make literals more readable int aMill = 1_000_000;</li>
  <li>Switch can handle strings now (basically uses the equalsTo on string)<pre>
     String dow = "MON";
     switch (dow) {
       case "SUN":
         System.out.println("Entered Sunday");
         break;
       case "MON":
         System.out.println("Entered Monday");
         break;
       default:
         System.out.println("Not valid day");
     }
  </pre></li>
  <li>Catching multiple exceptions, you can use OR in catch block to catch multiples<pre>
  	try { ... }
    catch (Exception1 | Exception2 | Exception3 e) { e.printStackTrace(); }</pre>
  </li>
  <li>try with resources, we'll use file io as example... in past: you open a file within 
  	  a try block, then have multiple catch's, and a finally block to close the file, but that
  	  finally block can also throw exceptions so you had to have another try block.  With
  	  version 7 they introduced auto closure to make it cleaner/simpler.  What you do
  	  is have the object that implements the autoclosable interface in the try () block, i.e <pre>
  	    try (FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream("test.txt");
  	         FileOutputStream os = new FileOutputStream("test.out")) { }</pre>
  	  when the try block section of code ends it automatically calls the close method (a class
  	  that implements the autocloseable interface just has to implement a close method)
  </li>
  <li>Type interface for generics: in old days you needed to have the type on the
  	  declaration and on instantiation i.e. <pre>
  	  ArrayList&lt;String&gt; oldWay = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();</pre>
  	  With java 7 you only need it on the declaration side<pre>
  	  ArrayList&lt;String&gt; newWay = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();</pre>
  </li>
</ul>  

<h3>Java 8 new features (project <strong>Java_New_Features</strong>)</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>New Date/Time API</dt>
	  <dd>Changes to date/time to address shortcomings of older java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar.
	  	<ul>
	  		<li>LocalDate - represents date (without time) in iso format (yyyy-MM-dd), can do
	  			   (LocalDate locDate = LocalDate.now() or .. LocalDate.of(2015,02,20) for 2/20/2015 Note
	  			   not 0 offset, or can do LocalDate.parse("2015-02-20")).  can use methods
	  			   <strong>.plusDays(n)</strong> to add days, if wanted to subtrace month can
	  			   do <strong>.minus(1, ChronoUnit.MONTHS)</strong>
	  	</ul>
	  </dd>
